// suppose create variable Automatically
// x is a variable
// .log is a method
x = 20;
console.log(x);


//  three types of variable in java script

//1. first variable
 var x = 10;
 console.log(x);

 // var is a keywords
 // x is a variable
 // 10 is a value

 // var is globle scope
 // Var keyword is use in old Browser
 //var variables can be re-declared and updated



 //2. second variable

 let a = 20;
 a = 15;
 console.log("a" , a);

 //let is block scoped
//let can be updated but not re-declared.


//3. Const Variable
 const p = 10;
 console.log(p);

 //const declarations are block scoped
//const cannot be updated or re-declared
//we don't want to change value
// const always use for decelering object or arrays



// whrite the diiference between var, let and const?

 // <--------- var variable --------------->
